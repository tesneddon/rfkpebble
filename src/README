* Message popup
    * fetches a random message over JS (because we don't have enough space).
    * keep some messages on the watch in case we can't reach the phone

* Movement
    * Up = RIGHT
    * Down = LEFT
    * Select+Up = UP
    * Select+Down = DOWN
    * Back is obvious :-)

* Gameplay
    * Landscape...

* Menu
    * About - pointer to site, and simple notes
    * Play - obvious
    * High Scores - really? Maybe count the number of moves

* Make the background in the menuIcon transparent so it behaves correctly
  when highlighted in the menu,

* Calculate inbound message size, max and included it.  The jaav script should be
  able to do this.  That way it is dynamic.
  Put an assert(INBOUND_SIZE <= app_message_max_size)

* Build messages.h each time so that we get different messages with each build
  of the app.
