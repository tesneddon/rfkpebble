The fonts used here are from the GNU FreeFont package, a family of free,
scalable outline fonts for general use on computers and for desktop
publishing.

In the case of the rfkpebble project, the standard FreeMono font is used for
the game characters.  Where as the # character from FreeMonoBold is used
for the robot.
